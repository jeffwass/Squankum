Simulation of Quantum Computation

Welcome to Squankum
--------
Currently Squankum lets you :

* Visualize a single qubit
    * Observe graphically the representation on a Bloch Sphere
    * Observe the relationship between the Bloch angular representation and spinor notation
* Perform single-qubit operations
* Observe representation of two coupled qubits (not fully implemented)

History of Squankum
--------
In 2003-2004 I developed an interactive Quantum Computation applet, as part of a technology fellowship with the [Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources](http://www.cer.jhu.edu). There was a fair amount of interest in this project, so in 2007 I renamed it as Squankum, and released the source code as Free Open Source Software under the GNU Public License.

Why did you choose the name Squankum?
--------

Firstly, Squankum sounds cool, something roughly like an abbreviation for Simulation of Quantum Computation.

But more realistically, Squankum is an old name for a town nearby Freehold, New Jersey where I grew up. Squankum itself is a name in the Algonquian language meaning "Place of Evil Ghosts", given to the area by the Native American Lenni-Lenape tribe. They were possibly referring to the mosquitos.
