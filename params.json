{"name":"Squankum","body":"## Welcome to Squankum\r\n\r\nCurrently Squankum lets you :\r\n* Visualize a single qubit\r\n * Observe the representation on a Bloch Sphere\r\n * Observe the relationship between the Bloch angular representation and spinor notation\r\n* Perform single-qubit operations\r\n* Observe representation of two coupled qubits (not fully implemented)\r\n\r\n## History of Squankum\r\n* Originally developed in 2003-2004 as part of a technology fellowship with <a href=\"http://www.cer.jhu.edu/\">Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources</a>\r\n* There had been a fair amount of interest in this project, and in 2007 I released the source code under the GPL\r\n\r\n## Why the name Squankum?\r\n* Firstly, Squankum sounds cool, something roughly like an abbreviation for Simulation of Quantum Computation. \r\n* More realistically, Squankum is an old name for a town nearby Freehold, New Jersey where I grew up.  Squankum itself is a name in the Algonquian language meaning \"Place of Evil Ghosts\", given to the area by the Native American Lenni-Lenape tribe. They were possibly referring to the mosquitos. The settlement of Squankum was formed in 1737 in what is now known as Monroe Township, and more information can be found at the be found at the <a href=\"http://monroetownshipnj.org/2-2/2b-history-of-monroe-township/\">History of Monroe Township page</a>.","tagline":"Simulation of Quantum Computation","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
